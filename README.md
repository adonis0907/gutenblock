# Install

`npm install gutenblock`

# Usage

`gutenblock init` will scaffold out a wordpress plugin for you.

Inside `src` you will create blocks matching the `example` one.

All blocks need a `block.js` and `edit.js`.

# Editing Components

We included a few helper components for inspector controls. We know this is not the ideal way to edit components in gutenberg, but it is much faster for those on a time crunch like us. You can see an example using editing inside gutenberg itself without the inspector too.
